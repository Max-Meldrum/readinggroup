The business models for cloud and datacentre computing emphasize reduced infrastructure costs. Cost efficiency is typically
achieved through workload consolidation, i.e., by co-locating workloads from multiple users on the same physical host to
maximize resource utilization. Despite its benefits, workload consolidation poses critical challenges. The main challenge is
the performance interference among the consolidated workloads, which is mainly caused by the contention over shared hardware
resources. To prevent the performance interference among the consolidated workloads, the importance of efficient partitioning
techniques for shared hardware resources is expeditiously increasing. Recent commodity CPUs have introduced hardware support
for managing shared resources. The chosen papers incentivize and provide a general guide to implement robust policies to
achieve maximum resource utilization by effectively employing the resource partitioning mechanisms provided by the hardware.
