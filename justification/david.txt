Significant advances in computing performance and the growth of big data has enabled the resurgence of machine learning. 
Although computer architects have been accelerating the performance of machine learning algorithms with GPUs and custom 
hardware, there have been few implementations leveraging these algorithms to improve the computer system performance. However, 
the few works that have done so in the areas of modeling, runtime prediction, cache replacement, branch prediction, and big 
data analysis have shown tremendous promise. The chosen papers incentivize and provide a general guide to computer architects 
for applying machine learning models to improve computer system performance. In particular, the first two papers demonstrate 
the potential of deep learning to address the bottleneck of memory performance in computer systems. The third paper 
demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to model the memory behavior of big data applications.
