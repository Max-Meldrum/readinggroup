Organisations use distributed stream processing systems to run never-ending services to drive their business-critical analytics. Therefore, it is crucial that the systems are fault-tolerant. The three papers that have been selected all take a different approach to achieve fault-tolerance and they are as following: (1) lineage-based recovery; (2) global consistent checkpointing; (3) distributed state store.
The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the tradeoffs between the different techniques. But, also to get an insight on which may be most applicable for future systems (Arcon) when taking the growing network speeds into consideration.
