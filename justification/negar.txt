My research involves Hidden Markov Models (a model for probabilistic directed graph) in terms of learning and speed
performance. These 3 below, all involve Hidden Markov Models. The first two concerns the speed performance for large Hidden
Markov Models and the last one is about learning of a mixture of them with an innovation in structuring involved matrices in
Hidden Markov Models.

1. zipHMMlib: a highly optimised HMM library exploiting repetitions in the input to speed up the forward algorithm
2. Fast Bayesian Inference of Copy Number Variants using Hidden Markov Models with Wavelet Compression
3. Spectral Learning of Mixture of Hidden Markov Models

I will possibly use and/or compare the papers in my next papers to be published. Paper 3 will be compared to my next
contribution and paper 1 and 2 will be used and/or compared in the paper after my next paper.
